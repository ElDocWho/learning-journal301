# LJ Code 301 - Day 6

  Today I learned the difference between AJAX and JSON. Here are the definitions
for each one:

**JSON** Acronym for JavaScript Object Notation is a lightweight data
interchange format. Its main application is in AJAX web application programming,
where it serves as an alternative to the use of the XML format for data exchange
between client and serve

**Ajax** Acronym for asynchronous JavaScript and XML) is a set of Web
development techniques using many Web technologies on the client side to
create asynchronous Web applications.

Jason I relate it very much to local storage, which is in what I have more
experience. To pus a JSON object in local storage we stringifiy and to get out
of local storage we parse. Here is an example of when you parse and when you
stringify:

**Storing data:**
myObj = { "name":"John", "age":31, "city":"New York" };
myJSON = JSON.stringify(myObj);
localStorage.setItem("testJSON", myJSON);

**Retrieving data:**
text = localStorage.getItem("testJSON");
obj = JSON.parse(text);
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = obj.name;
