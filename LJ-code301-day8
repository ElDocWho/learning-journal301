# LJ Code 301 - Day 6

  Today basically we learned about Node.js. This is the most useful definition
I found regarding Node.js: Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript run-time environment for executing JavaScript code server-side.

Node.js fetures:
**Asynchronous and Event Driven**
**Very Fast**
**Single Threaded but Highly Scalable**
**No Buffering**
**License, Node.js is released under the MIT license.**

  We covered PostgreSQL. PostgreSQL is a powerful, open source object-relational
database system.

**Example of SQL valid input:**

SELECT * FROM MY_TABLE;
UPDATE MY_TABLE SET A = 5;
INSERT INTO MY_TABLE VALUES (3, 'hi there');

  This is used to update. In SQL we basically go by CRUD.

Create --> Post
Read -->   Get
Update -->  Put
Destroy --> Delete
