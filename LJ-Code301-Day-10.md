# LJ Code 301 - Day 10

  The big topic for today was functional programing. The definition for
functional programming is:
In computer science, functional programming is a programming paradigm—a style of
 building the structure and elements of computer programs—that treats
 computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids
 changing-state and mutable data. 

We learned the following methods:

**.forEach()** method executes a provided function once for each array element.
**.map()** method creates a new array with the results of calling a provided
       function on every element in this array.
**.filter()**  method creates a new array with all elements that pass the test
 implemented by the provided function.
**.reduce().** method applies a function against an accumulator and each element
in the array (from left to right) to reduce it to a single value.
